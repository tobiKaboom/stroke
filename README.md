# stroke
the stroke is the embodyment of the 40s copypasta: we really did come up with a funny idea for a keyboard meme product (see the kle), then someone (me and obabo) spent actual time makind a cad model of it and then someone will spend real money on it just because noone had the sense to say "this is stupid" somewhere along the way.
