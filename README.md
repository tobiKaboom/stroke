# concept
the original idea was a QAZ with bruce-like column stagger, but due to the nature of geometry itself its hard to use both staggers at once. therefore, it has a lot of gaps.
i also forgot to properly make the column stagger on both sides so the left is a bit lower than the right.
# reactions
the initial reactions were unanimous: this board is hideous.

# case
to add to the jankiness, you can of course just mount a pcb over the other and keep it as a sandwich, or use obabo's one, which is much better but not compatible because it requires a daughter board while i use an rp2040 zero, and i swear i cannot integrate circuits so i guess obabo's case is good if you want to handwire?

# disclaimer
this board has not been tested and i do not claim responsibility over any errors or malfunctions in the pcb, case, plate or any other component
